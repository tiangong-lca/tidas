# Introduction

**TIDAS** (**TI**angong **DA**ta **S**ystem) is an open-source data system built on JSON, providing unified, standardized, and extensible foundational support for Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and carbon footprint management. It consists of three core modules: "Methodology, Format Specifications, and Data Resources," and through auxiliary tools and integration capabilities, enables intelligent, trustworthy, and automated data management.

## 🧱 Core System Architecture Modules

TIDAS architecture consists of three components:

### 📖 Methodology
- [LCA/Carbon Footprint Database Construction Guidelines](https://www.carbonfootprint.network/docs/category/lca-database-guideline)  
  Provides methods for data construction, validation and maintenance, compatible with ISO 14040/44, ILCD Handbook and ecoinvent standards.

### 🧾 Data Format
- [TIDAS Data Structure](/docs/category/tidas-schema)  
  Implements data structure validation based on JSON and JSON Schema, adaptable to new architectures like AI, data spaces and blockchain.

### 📦 Data Resources
- [Reference Data Package](https://github.com/linancn/EF-reference-package-3.1-Correction)  
  Provides open-source reference database supporting data traceability, consistency and reliability.

## 🛠 Auxiliary Tools

**The TIDAS Tools consists of auxiliary components developed around the three core modules**, facilitating data construction, format interoperability and export operations between developers and systems.

- 🧪 `validate`: Data validation tool - checks data structure, standardization and completeness  
- 🔄 `convert`: Format converter - enables lossless bidirectional conversion between TIDAS and eILCD  
- 📤 `export`: Data package publishing tool - packages compliant data into standard ZIP format for platform delivery and archiving
